    "PMF is a function that describes the probability of obtaining a specific value for a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a particular value. The PMF is defined for each possible value of the discrete random variable and the sum of all the probabilities for all possible values is equal to 1. For example, if we have a coin that we flip 5 times, the PMF would give the probability of getting 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, 3 heads, 4 heads, or 5 heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDF, on the other hand, is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike PMF, PDF is not defined for each possible value of the random variable, but instead is defined for a range of values. The area under the curve of the PDF between two points gives the probability that the value of the continuous random variable falls between those two points. For example, if we have a normally distributed random variable with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2, the PDF would give the probability of the variable taking on values within a certain range, such as the probability of the variable being between 8 and 12."
